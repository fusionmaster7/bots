# Getting Started

Ready to contribute, but not sure how or where to start?

> If you've never cloned a repository, or made a new branch or made a pull request before, we recommend taking a look at (https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github)

1. First up you need to fork (make a copy) this repo to your Github account.
2. Clone (download) your fork to your computer.
3. Set your streams so you can sync your clone with the original repo (get the latest updates).

   - `git remote add upstream https://github.com/fusionmaster7/bots.git`
   - `git pull upstream master`
   - The above 2 commands will synchronize your forked version of the project with the actual repository.

4. Create a branch for your task and complete the task.
5. Pull from the upstream again, like we did in step 3. This is to ensure we still have the latest code.
   - `git pull upstream master`

6. Commit and push the code to your fork.
    - After commiting, use the following code to push the code.
    - `git push origin branch-name:branch-name`
    - Here the branch-name will be the name you give to your branch.

7. The pull request will be reviwed and decided upon by the collaborators.
